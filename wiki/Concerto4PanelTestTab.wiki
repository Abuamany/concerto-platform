='tests' tab=

==general description==

On this tab you can create new tests and edit or delete existing ones. This is the central place in the whole panel. Users after creating a test will come back here to monitor error logs of the specific test. 

----

==main form==

http://concerto.e-psychometrics.com/demo/wiki/panel_test_form.png

You can set following test properties on test tab main form:

 * *name* - name of the test
 * *open* (visible in *advanced view*) - check this option to set test to be open for public, after that anyone will be able to run the test by selecting it from the test selection box
 * *loader* (visible in *advanced view*) - choose the template that will be shown when you submit the template and wait for another template to appear

----

==test logs==

http://concerto.e-psychometrics.com/demo/wiki/panel_test_logs.png

After creating the test and sharing it with test participants, you can monitor if there are any problems with the test here. Any problems related to test logic (*R*) or test templates (*javascript*) will be recorded here so you can eliminate it later.

Each error log will containt following informations:

 * *date* - date when the error occured
 * *type* - type of error, either *R* or *javascript*
 * *message* - error message describing the problem encountered
 * *browser* - test participant browser header
 * *IP* - test participant IP address

----

==test input and output variables==

http://concerto.e-psychometrics.com/demo/wiki/panel_test_variables.png

Declare test input parameters and return variables here. 

====Input parameters==== 

They are used to declare available URL parameters to pass to a test. If no input parameters are declared then no URL parameters are allowed to be passed. When declared on nested test ( test that is run inside another test by using *{{{concerto.test.run}}}* function from Concerto package ) they are the only available variables that can be passed in *{{{params}}}* named list argument.

====Output variables====

Variables declared here will form a return value of *{{{concerto.test.run}}}* (used to run test inside another test) function from Concerto package. The return type will be named list formed from variables declared as output variables. Return variables are also saved for all completed sessions and can be used later by *Concerto remote client* or any other external application.

----

==test logic==

http://concerto.e-psychometrics.com/demo/wiki/panel_test_logic.png

Test logic written in R code. You can use any R code you wish. Whatever R package you have installed on your system, it can be used in Concerto test logic code. Concerto comes in with its own R package named *{{{concerto}}}* which functions can also be used here. This section is the most important part of the whole Concerto panel as this is the place where you declare how the test should work.

When you start test debugging your test logic R code will be interpreted line by line and any output produced by R will be inserted below line of code that produced it.

To simplify process of writing R code, every function available in your R can be written using Concerto function wizard. To start function wizard for a specific function you have to start auto-completion tool, select the function of your choosing and press *Ctrl+Enter* or use *function toolbar* at the bottom left corner of your screen.

You can use following key commands when test logic R code has focus:

 * *Ctrl+Space* - code auto-completion, shows all available functions starting with the chars you entered before pressing Ctrl+Space
 * *F2* - auto-format selected code
 * *F11* - full screen code editor mode 

----

==test session state==

http://concerto.e-psychometrics.com/demo/wiki/panel_test_session_state.png

Used for test debugging. At the top it contains current debug session state information and two buttons for starting and stopping debug session. While debug there is ongoing debug session test logic code will go into read only mode. After stopping the debug session it will be editable again.

Test session state shows R logic session state. It will show any variable which is currently declared in your test session and it's value.

----

==test session output==

http://concerto.e-psychometrics.com/demo/wiki/panel_test_session_output.png

Used for test debugging. It will show you your test logic output.

----

==function toolbar==

http://concerto.e-psychometrics.com/demo/wiki/panel_test_function_toolbar.png 

It contains all Concerto functions from *{{{concerto}}}* R package in one place ready to be inserted into your test logic code as a function wizard. It also contains all functions you added to your *favourite functions*. You can remove any function previously added to favourites from here. You can get full R documentation of any function listed here by clicking the question mark icon next to the selected function.
