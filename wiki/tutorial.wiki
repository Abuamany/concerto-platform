== step 1: create item's presentation ==
=== `demo_start` ===
  * to create a new item click *'new'* button in the form on the left side of *'item'* tab
  * enter *'demo_start'* as an item name in the form
  * go to the *'Presentation and Properties'* tab, switch editor to *'Source'* mode and fill it with following content:

{{{
<p>
	This is a demo test.</p>
<p>
	Enter your name and click &#39;Start&#39; button.</p>
<p>
	name:&nbsp;<input name="field_name" type="text" /><input name="btn_start" type="button" value="Start" /></p>
}}}
*All of this can also be done in graphical mode but for demonstration purposes it will be easier just to copy the whole source in 'Source' mode.*

Now switch back to *'graphical'* mode.
We have a button here named *'btn_start'*. We can later assign R code to execute when we click on it while running test.
We also have here a text box named *'field_name'* which will be filled by user running test and we can use it's value later in HTML presentation or in R calculations.

=== `demo_item` ===
  * to create a new item click *'new'* button in the form on the left side of *'item'* tab
  * enter *'demo_item'* as an item name in the form
  * go to the *'Presentation and Properties'* tab, switch editor to *'Source'* mode and fill it with following content:

{{{
<p>
	{{field_name}} please answer the question:</p>
<p style="text-align: center; ">
	Question #{{current_question_no}}:</p>
<p style="text-align: center; ">
	{{question}}</p>
<p style="text-align: center; ">
	<input checked="checked" name="field_answer" type="radio" value="0" />no<input name="field_answer" type="radio" value="1" />yes</p>
<p style="text-align: center; ">
	<input name="btn_next" type="button" value="next" /><input name="btn_restart" type="button" value="restart" /></p>

}}}
*All of this can also be done in graphical mode but for demonstration purposes it will be easier just to copy the whole source in 'Source' mode.*

Now switch back to *'graphical'* mode.
See those double brackets with text inside them? You can insert session variables to your HTML presentation this way. This way *{{question}}* will be replaced by value of session variable named *question*.
On this item we have two buttons used to execute R code and two radio buttons from the same group ( they have the same name: *field_answer* ). Those radio buttons will be used by user running the test to give you the answer. Answer can be *yes* ( radio button value *0* ) or *no* ( radio button value *1* ).

=== `demo_feedback` ===
  * to create a new item click *'new'* button in the form on the left side of *'item'* tab
  * enter *'demo_feedback'* as an item name in the form
  * go to the *'Presentation and Properties'* tab, switch editor to *'Source'* mode and fill it with following content:

{{{
{{field_name}}, your total score is {{total_score}}.
}}}
*All of this can also be done in graphical mode but for demonstration purposes it will be easier just to copy the whole source in 'Source' mode.*

Only thing worth mentioning here are double brackets used for session variables insertion.
