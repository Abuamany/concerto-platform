= Our plans for the future developments of Concerto = 

Concerto is constantly evolving in response to the feedback of our users, currently we work on the following functionality:

== Pre-defined Item and User banks ==

For those who do not want to learn MySQL we will add flexible item banks and user/results tables editable from the level of the Administration Panel.


==Background Computation Module==
For slow connections and extensive Item Banks, Concerto will  allow to execute code and download content while item is presented. For instance, while user is thinking about the answer to a given question, R engine is using his previous responses to choose an item and pre-cache it in the local browser. When user submits the response, pre-cached question is showed immediately while Concerto works on choosing the next one. 

==Concerto Local==
Application controlling the administration of the test on the local machine (e.g. in a testing centre). It will lock the machine, allow to open the given test only, record system parameters (e.g. screen size) and user's behaviour (sound, video, keyboard if applicable). 

== Concerto Showcase ==
Demo version of Concerto hosted on our servers, allowing users to get accustomed with the application.
