= Concerto v3.0 Tutorials: Preventing 'no response' situations=

This tutorial explains how to prevent test takers from skipping items or missing questions, for one reason or the other. Essentially, you are making the items mandatory to avoid missing and, hence, biased data. 

It is assumed that youâ€™ve already taken the *[http://code.google.com/p/concerto-platform/wiki/Concerto3SimpleTest Concerto v3.0 Tutorials: Create a simple test]* section and are familiar with the basic functions of Concerto v3.0.

*Note:*
 * This document is relevant to Concerto v3.0. If you use an older version, please upgrade it (or else refer to relevant tutorials).
 * You may experience some problems while using different browsers. Currently, it is best to use Google Chrome to run the administration panel.

==Creating a loop==
The basic concept here is to loop the test logic sections such that the testee is presented with the same item page until he/she responds. In many cases, this merely involves the addition of a few conditional statements. The conditional statements specify that IF no response is selected/given THEN the same question should be presented.

*Radio Buttons in Concerto v3*
When no option is selected from a group of radio buttons (with similar names but different values), the response is validated as NA in R and "NA" (string) in HTML/MySQL by default. i.e. this makes our life easier since we do not have to _set variable_ as NA or -9999 for missing data. 

The only step is to create a loop with the help of a conditional 'IF' statement (see picture below).

|| IF statement || *response* - *equal* - *""* (empty string) *OR* - *suppressWarnings(!is.na(as.numeric(response)))* - *not equal* - *T* THEN _GO TO_ *14.load HTML template* (this is the section where you load the items template). This step is to ensure that there are no missing responses or non-numeric type responses. ||
