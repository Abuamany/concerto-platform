===What is the best way to learn to use Concerto?===
Working with Concerto v3.0 can be fairly easy if you are well oriented with the user interface. The easiest way to get started is to go through the tutorials. Once you are familiar with the *[http://code.google.com/p/concerto-platform/wiki/Concerto3Tabs General manual]*, you should attempt to explore the sections by yourself. Next, go through the tutorial and *[http://code.google.com/p/concerto-platform/wiki/Concerto3SimpleTest create a simple test]* exactly as instructed. Following this, try to upload a few simple tests using the techniques that you have already learnt. Then, go through the tutorial and *[http://code.google.com/p/concerto-platform/wiki/Concerto3AdaptiveTest create an adaptive test]*. Again, once you have mastered the tutorial, attempt to create your own tests by applying the recently learnt techniques.
