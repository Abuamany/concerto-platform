=Concerto R package=

==general concept==

Since starting from Concerto v4 there is code auto-complete and R function documentation (available for any R package installed on your system) available for users writing code, we decided to include Concerto built in functions also as a R package.

 * *workspaceID* - set this if you want to use template from different workspace then the one where the test is located

====returns====
