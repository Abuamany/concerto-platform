=Concerto test run environment=

This is the environment where all tests are run. There are four mechanisms here that lets your users run the test.

The URL for test run environment is exactly the same as your Concerto installation path.

==1. Running the test directly using the URL paramaters==

Lets assume that *{{{http://domain.com/}}}* is the URL for your test environment and you have a test with id #1 created in the workspace with id #2. You can use:

*{{{http://domain.com/?wid=2&tid=1}}}* 

as the direct link to your test. You can give it to anyone and he or she will be able to run your test. 

*{{{?}}}* - question mark means we are starting declaration of URL parametes

*{{{wid=2}}}* - means that the first variable we declare is named *{{{wid}}}* and we set it's value to *{{{2}}}*, *{{{wid}}}* stands for *workspace id*

*{{{&}}}* - ampersand means that we want to declare additional parameter

*{{{tid=1}}}* - and it will be variable named *{{{tid}}}* with it's value set to *{{{1}}}*, *{{{tid}}}* stands for *test id*

If your test supports any additional parameters passed by URL you can declare them after *{{{wid}}}* and *{{{tid}}}* parameters. If for example you would like to add additional variable named *{{{var1}}}* and set it's value to *"example"* you would use following URL:

*{{{http://domain.com/?wid=2&tid=1&var1=example}}}*
