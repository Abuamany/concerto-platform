#summary This tutorial helps the reader to deepen his or her understanding of Concerto v4 by creating a personality test (nonadaptive).

= Introduction =

This tutorial intends to help you create a psychological test (non-adaptive) with Concerto. By taking the reader through the entire process of implementing a test – from analyzing the test and determining what type of pages and data tables are required, over creating both templates and tables, to writing the test logic in R – his or her understanding of R and the Concerto platform should be furthered.
It is assumed that the reader already familiarized him- or herself with the Concerto platform (i.e. took one of the simple tutorials) and has a basic understanding of R or any other experience in programming/scripting languages
The test that will be implemented in this tutorial is the Big Five Personality Test. It consists of 50 Questions that can be answered on a five point Likert scale, with options ranging from “disagree” to “agree”. A sample can be accessed at http://personality-testing.info/print/big-five-personality-test.pdf
In addition to the test itself, three demographical variables are going to be assessed: age, gender, and occupation. At the end of the test, the participant will be informed of his or her result, along with an explanation of these results.


= Preparation =
== Pages ==

In order to create this test on Concerto, it needs to be considered what type of pages needs to be shown to a participant to fulfill the requirements above.
  # Introductory page: upon starting the test, the participant should see some introductory words about the test. At the same page he or she can enter the demographic information
  # Question page: the test itself consists of 50 questions that need to be asked. Therefore there needs to be a page where the questions are asked
  # Result/Goodbye page:  once a participant answered all questions, his or her results are going to be shown to him, along with an explanation
Therefore, we already know that three pages are required.  The next step is to determine, what kind of data is going to be used in the test.
