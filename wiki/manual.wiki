=USER'S MANUAL=

= Concept =
The idea behind Concerto is to deliver a simple yet powerful tool for the development of an adaptive on-line test. 
The platform relies on three main elements:
 # *HTML presentation layer* 
 # *R scripting logic* 
 # *SQL database backbone*

We rely as much as possible on popular open source packages in order to maximize the safety and reliability of the system, and to ensure that its elements are kept up-to-date. 

= Installation ( v2.0 ) =

*DO NOT* install Concerto v2.x on the database used for Concerto v1.x. Create new database to avoid any incompatibility errors.

  # extract the contents of the [http://code.google.com/p/concerto-platform/downloads/list installation zip archive] to the public web folder of your choice on your server.
  # edit *installation_path/SETTINGS.php* file to set your MySQL database connection parameters.
  # run the *installation_path/setup.php* page and follow the instructions.

== Setup Page ==

The Setup Page is the first page that should be run when extracting Concerto files. It allows you to check whether your system meets all requirements and to finalize the setup of the application. If you pass all the checks here you should not have any problem with running Concerto. The tests consists of:
 * PHP settings check, 
 * Directory rights check, 
 * MySQL configuration check, 
 * etc. 

The setup page will also allow you to create a login for the first user's login and password, your application installation external URL, RScript path and RStudio integration. This page also checks if there is a newer version of *Concerto Platform* available. If any of the checks fail then the setup page will give recommendations on how to fix it. You should restart the Setup Page after solving the problem.

=Test and Item Template Creator / Administrator Panel =

To create or edit tests and item templates go to the administration panel: *installation_path/admin*. 

* We suggest that you start with a [http://code.google.com/p/concerto-platform/wiki/tutorial Step-by-Step tutorial].

You can also create user accounts here and set the access rights. The Administration Panel has multi-language support. You can find the list of currently supported languages at the project's page. Let us know if you want to contribute and provide us with a translation to another language! 

The default language is English. To use another supported language, e.g. Polish, set the  *lng* option in the URL, e.g. */admin/?lng=pl*. This will (PL stands for Polish here).


== Elements of the administration Panel ==

There are several sections in the Administration Panel

== Header ==

http://dev.myiqtest.org/concerto2/wiki_images/admin_header.PNG

Buttons on the left allow you to quickly navigate to:
 * *Concerto Platform homepage on code.google.com* where you can find  support, report an issue with the application, download the latest version or just browse through the source code.
 * *Concerto Platform Google Group* where you can subscribe to receive the latest news about *Concerto* development and our future plans. 

The central area of the header contains the Concerto version. Below you can find the link to newer version of the system if available. 

On the right side you'll the find the information about the currently logged-in administrator and a log out button.

=="Items" tab==

Items Tab is the heart of whole application. Here you can create/edit/debug item templates and R syntax.

http://dev.myiqtest.org/concerto2/wiki_images/admin_item.PNG

=== "Items" tab -> Add/Edit/Debug the item templates ===

http://dev.myiqtest.org/concerto2/wiki_images/admin_items_formlist.PNG

Add new item template:
 * Click "New" to add a new item template.
 * Set it's name in the "Name" box.
 * Set it's sharing rights

The list of available item templates consists all of the items that the currently logged user has the right to see. It has a few columns: 
    # *ID* - the item template's unique system id.
    # *name* - the item template's name typed by the user, which is used in R interactions to switch item templates.
    # *hash* - hash generated by system is used to set the starting item template when running the test.
    # *owner* - the person that created the item template and has full rights to modify it.
    # *sharing* - the sharing level of the specific item template.

Additionally, there are 3 action buttons:
 # *debug* - start the test using the given item template in debug mode
 # *edit* - edit the selected item template
 # *delete* - deletes the selected item template

The list can be sorted by clicking on the column header. Use a search box to search for a specific item. The list is paginated, and you can select how many items should be displayed per page and which page you want to see.

==="items" tab -> "Presentation and Properties" tab===

http://dev.myiqtest.org/concerto2/wiki_images/admin_items_presentation.PNG

We can divide this section into three parts:
  # the Duplicate Item Template panel allows us to import the HTML layer from another item. Simply select the "source" item from the list and click the *import HTML* button.
  # the HTML WYSIWYG editor (open-source *CKEditor*) in the middle - use it to design the Item Template's HTML layer)
  # Item properties, containing:
    * *default button* - select the button (actually, the R script behind it) that is going to be executed if the time runs out and user has not clicked any button
    * *timer* sets the maximum time allowed to answer the question in the item. When time runs out, the platform executes the R script assigned to "default button"

The HTML WYSIWYG editor allows you to insert any HTML/CSS/JS code. 
Important elements include:
  # *HTML buttons and image buttons* - HTML buttons can have assigned *R code to execute*. Whenever the user clicks on the button, the assigned code is executed.  
  # *Other standard HTML controls* including text fields, text areas, radio buttons, check boxes, drop-down lists, etc. can be used to interact with the user. When the item is submitted, all user entered values will be stored as session variables and sent to R. You can then use them to customize any following items and/or use those variables in R scripts/calculations.
  # *session variable inserts* - You can insert any session variable anywhere in the HTML layer by defining a piece to be inserted using  double brackets and the name of the session variable (e.g. *{{variable_name}}*). This allows you to control the HTML layer from R or any other external application by simply adding an entry to the session variable tables. 
  # *standard HTML/CSS/JS* code: text, videos, sounds, images, etc.  

=== "items" tab -> "R Interaction" tab===
http://dev.myiqtest.org/concerto2/wiki_images/admin_items_interaction.PNG

This section contains a list of the HTML buttons that were declared (added) to the HTML presentation layer. You can use *R code to execute* to assign R syntax that will be executed once the button is pressed by the user (or if time runs out in the case of buttons set as default). 

You can also open two "hint" boxes in this section. You can resize/move/close these boxes at any time. 
 # *Concerto built in R functions documentation* - list of Concerto functions that you can use anywhere in the R syntax.
 # *item's session variables* that contains:
   * *sent session variables* (the list of variables acquired from the current Item Template after it is submitted), 
   * *inserted session variables* (the list of inserted variables for a given item. Concerto will look for these variables in the Sessions table to customize the Item template)

=="RStudio" tab==
http://dev.myiqtest.org/concerto2/wiki_images/admin_rstudio.PNG

If you have *RStudio* installed on your server you can integrate it with the *Concerto Platform*. It's optional, and you can always switch it on or off using the *setup page* mentioned earlier. 

Use your system account (unix/linux) to enter R studio. 

RStudio can be useful to:
 * develop and test R code.
 * analyse the results/item banks/etc. directly on the server.
 * manage the files on the server (it has a convenient file manager). 

=="Users" tab==
http://dev.myiqtest.org/concerto2/wiki_images/admin_users.PNG

This tab is only accessible for *super admin* users. It allows him/her to add/remove/edit users and user groups, and to define access rights.

You can set the user's login, password, first name, last name, email, phone no., and a user group. 

=== User groups ===

You can use the "sharing" option to assign an item template to one of three groups:
 # public (all administrators can see/edit it)
 # private (only you can see/edit it)
 # group (only members of your group can see/edit it)

Super Admins can add/edit groups and assign users to groups in the "Users Tab".

= Running tests =

==Standard mode==

To start the test in standard mode, use the following URL:
{{{
Concerto_installation_path/index.php?hash=[item_hash] 
}}}

You can get the item's hash from the item template's list. Here is an example of the URL:  
{{{
http://dev.myiqtest.org/concerto2/index.php?hash=ab0334826613005bfcf26d52392b7ced
}}}

==Debug mode==
http://dev.myiqtest.org/concerto2/wiki_images/run_debug.PNG

To start the test in *debug mode* select the *Debug* button from the Item Template's List. Alternatively, if you are an administrator you can enter debug mode by passing the *debug* option through the URL, e.g. 
{{{
Concerto_installation_path/index.php?hash=5da7d117adfd5632b8e8aa661426879f&debug
}}}
*You must be logged in to the Administration Panel to do so.* 

You will see a screen divided into two sections:
  # LEFT: The log of whatever is happening behind the scenes, including:
    # R code executed
    # R errors
  # RIGHT: Item that would be visible during normal test execution 

Additionally, you can use the buttons at the top of the page to see the list of:
 # current *session variables* 
 # variables sent to R (*R variables*)
