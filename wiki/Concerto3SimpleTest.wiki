This tutorial will help you create a simple test on Concerto v3.6. 
You can preview the test here: *[http://concerto.e-psychometrics.com/demo/?tid=61 Concerto v3 Simple Test]*

Obviously, this is a very basic test, but it easily shows the idea behind Concerto. Don't forget to add formatting of your choice to make the test professional/pretty! The tests that you develop can be run as a separate website or embedded in the other websites or applications.

==Login to Concerto==
It is best to use Google Chrome to run the Concerto administration panel. Please ensure that you have Concerto v3.0 or higher, preferably the latest version v3.6. Go to *concerto_installation_path/cms/* and login using your credentials. If you haven't installed Concerto on your server, you can use our demo installation. [http://concerto.e-psychometrics.com/demo/cms/ CLICK HERE] to get a _free basic account_ or _login to an existing account_ hosted on our server.


==Concept==

The test you create will be composed of three HTML Templates:
 * *Introduction* - A page where the user can enter his/her name which will be used later to customise other HTML templates.
 * *Test items* - A page with your test items and dichotomous (yes/no) response options.
 * *Feedback* - A page containing the user's score.
 

==Step 1: Create HTML Templates==
===Introduction template===
 * _Create a template:_ Click the “HTML templates” tab on the upper left side of the page. Click the ‘+ add new object’ icon above the list of available objects. Enter a unique name for the template (E.g. “introduction”) and click ‘save’ at the bottom of the page.  
 * _Add suitable text:_ Type in a welcome message and instructions for the participants. 
 * _Add a user input field:_ Click the 'Text Field' button and enter a name (E.g. user_name). Click ‘OK’. Ensure that your instructions indicate that participants should type their name here.
 * _Add a Start button:_ Click the ‘Button’ icon and enter a name (e.g. btn_start), text (“Start”) and click ‘OK’.
 * Save the template!

=== Test Items Template===
 * _Create a template:_ Click the “HTML templates” tab on the upper left side of the page. Click the ‘+ add new object’ icon above the list of available objects. Enter a unique name for the template (E.g. “items”) and click ‘save’ at the bottom of the page. 
 * _Add questions/text:_ Edit the template and add the following text:
{{user_name}}, please answer the following question: 
{{question}}
 * _Add radio buttons:_ Click ‘Radio Button’ and assign a name ("radio1") and value ("0"); click ‘OK’. Type "No" next to it. Similarly, create another radio button with the same name but different value (1) and type "Yes" next to it.
 * _Add a Submit button:_ Click ‘Button’ and assign a name ("btn_submit") and text value ("Submit"). Click ‘OK’.
 * Save the template!

===Feedback Template===
 * _Create a template:_ Click the “HTML templates” tab on the upper left side of the page. Click the ‘+ add new object’ icon above the list of available objects. Enter a unique name for the template (E.g. “feedback”) and click ‘save’ at the bottom of the page.  
 * _Add text:_ Add text suitable for the feedback page, including:
    {{user_name}}, your total score is {{total_score}}.
 * Save the template!

==Step 2: Creating an item bank==

Go to the ‘tables’ tab (next to HTML templates). 
 * _Add a new table:_ Click the ‘+ add new object’ icon above the list of available objects. Assign a name and save it.
 * _Add columns:_ Click the ‘+ add’ icon located in the 'table structure definition'. Enter the column name (“question”) and select string as the data type. Click ‘+ add’. Add a second column (“answer”) consisting of 'integer' data and a third column (“item_id”), also consisting of 'integer' data.
_Your item bank is nearly done. Now you need to fill the table with the items in your test. The items should be structured such that they can be answered with yes/no options, as in your “items” template._
 * _Add rows:_ Click the ‘+ add’ icon in the 'table data' section (located below the table structure definition). Now, you can directly type in your items and corresponding answers by clicking within the relevant data cell. 
 Note: In your Items template, you have assigned 0 to a radio button described as “No” and 1 to a radio button described as “Yes”. Thus, if “yes” is the correct answer to your question – put 1 in the Answer column. If “no” is the correct answer, put 0 in the Answer column. Fill item_id with consecutive numbers starting from 1.
 * Save your table!

_Note: You can import your tables from CSV files (R, SPSS, Excel) and also manage tables using a professional MySQL tool._

==Step 3: Creating and adding sections to your test==

Go to the ‘tests’ tab on the upper left side of the page. Create a new test by clicking the ‘+ add new object’ icon above the list of available objects (it is likely to be empty!). Assign a relevant name for the test and click ‘OK’.

To edit a test at any time, click on the pencil symbol towards the right of the specific test you want to edit. Be careful not to click the ‘bin’ icon (last symbol on the right) unless you wish to delete your test!

This step involves editing your test overall. Click the ‘tests’ tab on the upper left side of the page and click the pencil icon on your specific test to edit it. To add a new section, click the ‘+’ at the right side of the last section. At this point, the last section is ‘1. start’.

Follow the table below to add new sections to your test, using the editor. Please _double-check your test logic sections_ using the _text_ and _screen shots_ provided to avoid any errors that may prevent your test from running currently!


|| *SECTION TYPE* || *DETAILS* ||
|| Load HTML template || Choose the HTML template: *introduction* (or whatever name you gave to this HTML template).||
|| Set variable || SET VARIABLE:  *current_question*  by R code:  *1*  (We will use this variable to control which question to shown!)||
|| Set variable || SET VARIABLE:  *total_score*  by R code:  *0*.  (This variable will be used to count the total score of the individual.)||
|| - || http://ns39618.ovh.net/~vaishali/v3.6/simple/1.JPG ||

|| *SECTION TYPE* || *DETAILS* ||
|| Set variable || SET VARIABLE: *question*  from table: *simple_test_table*  COLUMN: *question*  WHERE: *item_id* _equal_ *current_question*  (Note what happens - we simply select one cell from the table you’ve created earlier. Concerto will take the content of the cell in the “question” column and a row where item_id equals 1 (you have set current_question to 1, previously))||
|| Set variable || SET VARIABLE: *answer*  from table: *simple_test_table*  COLUMN: *answer*  WHERE: *item_id* _equal_ *current_question*.  (Now we set variable “answer” to the appropriate value from the table.)||
|| Load HTML template || Choose the HTML template: *items* (or whatever name you gave to this HTML template). ||
|| - ||http://ns39618.ovh.net/~vaishali/v3.6/simple/2.JPG ||

|| *SECTION TYPE* || *DETAILS* ||
|| IF statement || IF *is.na(radio1)* _equal_ *T*  THEN click '+' icon below 'THEN'. GO TO SECTION: *load items template* (i.e. go to the previous section in your test. This step presents the testee with the same item if no radio button is selected.) ||
|| IF statement || IF *answer* _equal_ *radio1*  THEN click '+' icon below 'THEN'. SET VARIABLE: *total_score*  by R code  *total_score+1* (Simple! IF answer is equal to the value of the radio button selected by the user THEN increase total score by 1. _Note: to add the next section “outside of the if clause” use the ‘+’ icon at the very bottom of the entire IF statement box._)||
|| - || http://ns39618.ovh.net/~vaishali/v3.6/simple/3.JPG||

|| *SECTION TYPE* || *DETAILS* ||
|| Set variable || SET VARIABLE:  *current_question*  by R code:  *current_question+1*  (Add one to the current_question value to select the 2nd question from the table next time!)||
|| IF statement || IF *current_question*  _equal or lesser than_  *4* THEN click '+' icon below 'THEN'. GO TO: *(from the drop-down list select the section of the test where you were setting the value of the “question” variable)* Ok, this one looks difficult but it is not! First you check IF you haven’t reached the maximum number of questions you wanted to show. If you haven’t THEN you go back in the test structure –not to the very beginning but to the place where you were getting some values from the table. Lastly, click the ‘+’ at the bottom of the IF statement box to add a new section.||
|| Load HTML template || Choose the HTML template: *feedback* (or whatever else you named this template)||
