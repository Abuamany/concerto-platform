='users' tab=

==general description==

This is the place where super administrators of Concerto can add new users. Regular users can also use this section to change their profile information, manage their workspaces or add grants to other user for specific workspace.

Workspaces are separate databases where one user can have multiple tests, templates, tables, etc and no one else has access to that unless the owner grants access to that workspace to someone. One user can have unlimited number of workspaces and he can give access to any workspace to unlimited number of other users. Anyone with access to your workspace will have full access to it which means that they also can delete any object that is inside it (they can't however give access to anyone else).
