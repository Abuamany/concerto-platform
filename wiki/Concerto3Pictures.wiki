==Uploading Files to the Host Server==

An essential part of setting up web pages is its publication. This includes uploading related files (pictures etc.) to the host server where the web page is likely to be located. More specifically, an FTP program is used for this purpose. In the case of a test, images and clips need to be uploaded to a publicly (www) accessible directory. Thus, the first step is to get an FTP account with a public access directory and upload the relevant files.

==Inserting Images Using Image Icon==
The best way to insert images is to do so directly using the toolbar in the templates tab. Click the _image_ icon http://ns39618.ovh.net/~vaishali/mini/img_btn.jpg and enter relevant details as shown below.

URL: _www location of your uploaded files_
Alternative Text: _Brief description of image_
Width, Height, Border, HSpace, VSpace, Align: _size, position etc._

You can preview your image as you type the specifications. Click OK to insert image into the HTML template.

==Insert Audio & Video Clips Using Link Icon==
Inserting audio and video clips can be done via the _link_ icon http://ns39618.ovh.net/~vaishali/mini/link_btn.jpg on the toolbar. Specify the details of the link as shown below. Further, you can also set the _target_ such that the video/audio clip opens in the same window or pop-up window etc. You can embed the link in text or an icon image by selecting the text/image and then clicking the _link icon_.

==Inserting Images & Clips via the Source==
Another way of adding interesting elements to your test is by directly inserting HTML code into the source of the template. 

http://ns39618.ovh.net/~vaishali/mini/source_btn.jpg - Click the _source_ icon in the toolbar to view/edit the HTML code.


For example, pasting the following code into the source page will add background music to your test page.

*<embed autostart="true" hidden="true" loop="false" src="http://ns39618.ovh.net/~abcde/Nara.mp3"></embed>* 

The _src_ attribute has to be necessarily modified (substitute the url of your audio clip). The other attributes in the code can be modified to suit your needs. _autostart_ indicates whether the song file should start playing automatically or not. _hidden_ indicates whether the media player is hidden or not. _loop_ indicates whether the clip should be repeated.
