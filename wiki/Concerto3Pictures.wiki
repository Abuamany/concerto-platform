==Uploading Files to the Host Server==

An essential part of setting up web pages is its publication. This includes uploading related files (pictures etc.) to the host server where the web page is likely to be located. More specifically, an FTP program is used for this purpose. In the case of a test, images and clips need to be uploaded to a publicly (www) accessible directory. Thus, the first step is to get an FTP account with a public access directory and upload the relevant files. Don't freak out if you dont understand this... just Google it!
